# RITIM

RITIM is a rhythm game developed using drywetmidi. 

For the leaderboard, I used the video of Royal Skies at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoGnxoJR_s4.

Additionally, there is a "Conductor" class created to make objects react to the music. With this class, any object can be made responsive to the music.

I'm sharing this project, developed for Ritim Jam 2024, as open-source here.

Itch.io => https://aeterponis.itch.io/ritim

## Features

- Game spawn objects according to the MIDI file.
- earn points by pressing the notes at the right time in the right position.
- online leaderboard system.
